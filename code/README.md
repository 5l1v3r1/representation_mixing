# WARNING
This folder contains a NON-RUNNABLE code dump of my research library used for training the model. This is only for very, very interested people and for seeing the exact model definition and dirty details in code.

The actual json files containing char and phone alignments and timing, used for training can be directly downloaded from here https://www.dropbox.com/s/1m73uf2mslvq0t5/gentle_json.tar.gz?dl=0

The gentle_json files were extracted using utilities from my repo https://github.com/kastnerkyle/raw_voice_cleanup/blob/master/alignment/align_many.py

If you just want to hear sound, use the colab here https://colab.research.google.com/github/kastnerkyle/representation_mixing/blob/master/pretrained/representation_mixing_text_to_speech_demo.ipynb
